This is a repository for the Introduction to Data Science course project. The specific project
was chosen because airlines and airports are responsible and interested in good satisfaction of its
customers and should be aware of the aspects that matter and impact the experience the most.

The repository contains 3 jupyter notebook files. Each aims to accomplish the goals that we set for this project.
To replicate what the authors have done, you have to run the 3 jupyter notebook files.
