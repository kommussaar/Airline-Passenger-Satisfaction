### Authors:

This is a repository for the Introduction to Data Science course project. The specific project
was chosen because airlines and airports are responsible and interested in good satisfaction of its
customers and should be aware of the aspects that matter and impact the experience the most.

The goals for this project:
- Gain insights into the data by exploring key features and visualizing patterns.
- Understand which features are impacting the overall satisfaction scores the most.
- Generate insights into the typical profile of a satisfied customer, which can help airlines target improvements toward underrepresented or dissatisfied groups.
- Find the best machine learning model for predicting whether a customer is satisfied or not based on various attributes.

The repository contains 3 jupyter notebook files. The code in the files aims to accomplish the goals that we set for this project.
- The goal1.ipynb is used to gain insights into the data by exploring key features and visualizing patterns.
- The goal2.ipynb is used to understand which features are impacting the overall satisfaction scores the most
- The goal3-4.ipynb is used to generate insights into the typical profile of a satisfied customer and to find the best machine learning model for predicting whether a customer is satisfied or not based on various attributes

To replicate what the authors have done, you have to run the 3 jupyter notebook files.
Data for the project is from [https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?order=date_added%2Cdesc&page=2&pageSize=20 Airline Passenger Satisfaction](https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?order=date_added%2Cdesc&search=Airline%20Passenger%20Satisfaction)
